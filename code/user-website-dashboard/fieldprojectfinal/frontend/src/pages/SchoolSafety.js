            like reporting fire hazards or practicing safe evacuation can make a big difference. Fire safety starts 
            with YOU! Be prepared, stay calm, and always put safety first. Together, we can prevent fire hazards and

          <h2>Essential School Fire Safety Tips</h2>
          <ul className="safety-tips-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Know Your Evacuation Routes</strong>
              <p>Familiarize yourself with all emergency exits and evacuation routes from your classroom, cafeteria, gym, and other areas you frequent at school.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Follow Fire Drill Procedures</strong>
              <p>Take every fire drill seriously. Follow directions, stay calm, walk quickly but don't run, and never use elevators during an evacuation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Report Safety Hazards</strong>
              <p>If you notice overloaded electrical outlets, broken equipment, or blocked exits, report them to your teacher or administrator immediately.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Never Pull False Alarms</strong>
              <p>False alarms waste resources and can cause unnecessary panic. They can also lead to serious consequences for the person responsible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learn to Use Fire Extinguishers</strong>
              <p>Older students should learn the PASS technique: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, and Sweep. However, only attempt to fight very small fires if it's safe to do so.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
